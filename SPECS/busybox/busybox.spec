%description
BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a
single executable. It provides minimalist replacements for utilities
usually found in fileutils, shellutils, findutils, textutils, grep,
gzip, tar, and more. BusyBox provides a fairly complete POSIX
environment for small or embedded systems. The utilities in BusyBox
generally have fewer options than their GNU cousins. The options that
are included provide the expected functionality and behave much like
their GNU counterparts.
BusyBox is for emergency and special use cases. Replacing the standard
tools in a system is not supported. Some tools don't work out of the
box but need special configuration, like udhcpc, the dhcp client.

%conf # BusyBox has no configuration script.

%build -p
make defconfig # Create the maximum "sane" configuration.

%install # BusyBox needs to be installed manually.
         # Arch Linux for reference.
install -Dm0755 busybox %{buildroot}%{_bindir}/busybox
install -Dm644 docs/busybox.1 %{buildroot}%{_mandir}/man1/busybox.1

%check -p
# This test might not fit OBS environment.
