%description
Package gorilla/mux implements a request router and dispatcher for
matching incoming requests to their respective handler.

The name mux stands for "HTTP request multiplexer". Like the standard
http.ServeMux, mux.Router matches incoming requests against a list of
registered routes and calls a handler for the route that matches the URL
or other conditions. The main features are:

 * It implements the http.Handler interface so it is compatible with the
   standard http.ServeMux.
 * Requests can be matched based on URL host, path, path prefix, schemes,
   header and query values, HTTP methods or using custom matchers.
 * URL hosts, paths and query values can have variables with an optional
   regular expression.
 * Registered URLs can be built, or "reversed", which helps maintaining
   references to resources.
 * Routes can be used as subrouters: nested routes are only tested if
   the parent route matches. This is useful to define groups of routes
   that share common conditions like a host, a path prefix or other
   repeated attributes. As a bonus, this optimizes request matching.
