%description
The Cython language makes writing C extensions for the Python language as easy
as Python itself. Cython is a source code translator based on Pyrex,
but supports more cutting edge functionality and optimizations.

The Cython language is a superset of the Python language (almost all Python
code is also valid Cython code), but Cython additionally supports optional
static typing to natively call C functions, operate with C++ classes and
declare fast C types on variables and class attributes.
This allows the compiler to generate very efficient C code from Cython code.

This makes Cython the ideal language for writing glue code for external C/C++
libraries, and for fast C modules that speed up the execution of Python code.
